# Patch `cattrs` structure factory to ignore init=False field in `attrs`
# Q: Why we should ignore init=False field in attrs?
# A: TLDR: High version `cattrs` is Incompatible with `attrs`
#   ---
#   At first, `attrs` will refuse those fields marked with init=False when we call the default `__init__` function
#   > if we send a field marked with init=False, the program will raise TypeError
#   Secondly, for `cattrs=1.0`, we call cattrs.structure(obj, cl) will send all fields of obj to cl.__init__() directly
#   > we can simply regart `cattrs.structure(obj, cl)` as `cl(**obj)`
#   However, for `cattrs>1.0`, this simply logic is replaced with a code-generation function `make_dict_structure_fn`,
#   in the new function `make_dict_structure_fn`, `cattrs` will try to get all fields of `cl` from `obj`
#   but no longer ignore `KeyError` exception。
#   > The new logic is Incompatible with `attrs` now.
#   So, we should register a structure hook for cattrs default converter to ignore init=False field in `attrs`
