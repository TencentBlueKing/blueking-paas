## leaderElectionReleaseOnCancel defines if the leader should step down volume
## when the Manager ends. This requires the binary to immediately end when the
## Manager is stopped, otherwise, this setting is unsafe. Setting this significantly
## speeds up voluntary leader transitions as the new leader don't have to wait
## LeaseDuration time first.
## In the default scaffold provided, the program ends immediately after
## the manager stops, so would be fine to enable this option. However,
## if you are doing or is intended to do any operation such as perform cleanups
## after the manager stops then its usage might be unsafe.
# leaderElectionReleaseOnCancel: true

## groupKindConcurrency defines how many workers each kind of
